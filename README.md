# BetaMind
A community-led platform for users to reach out to others in their times of need. Users can post about their feelings and their current mood, and others can offer their support by offering their recognition, and communicating with those looking for someone to lean on.

Additionally, users can talk to our own Chatbot, and enjoy uplifting content.

The team members for this project were: Daniel PR, Alissa Troiano, Andrew Curley,Oliver Cadman & Sandra Atino

Deployed website can be viewed [here]().

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to provide a sleek, intuitive solution for users who need to discuss their emotions, whether negative or positive, with an un-biased, attentive community. The website should intelligently determine whether the user is in need of professional help, through the analysis of key words in the user's text content when making a blog post. If a user requires professional help, they should be presented with a comprehensive list of options to pursue, to help them in a positive direction.

If the user doesn't want to talk about their feelings, they should also enjoy the extra features of the website; our custom ChatBot 'OPPO' and interactive games.

## UX Design

### Site Owner Goals

1. To establish BetaMind as a trusted brand when users are looking for a friendly community to talk to.
2. To maximise user retention through a positive, intuitive UX.
3. To ensure that the website is responsive across all screen sizes.
4. Employ a mobile-first design, to cater to users who may be commuting or away from a desktop/laptop computer.
5. To guarantee that the system recognizes when a person is feeling particularly terrible, and suggests options for professional help.

### User Stories

## Bugs

## Deployment

#### Requirements 
- Python3 
- Github account 
- MongoDB account 
- Heroku account


#### Clone the project 
To make a local clone, follow the following steps. 
1. Log in to GitHub and go to the repository. 
2. Click on the green button with the text **"Code".**
3. Click on **"Open with GitHub Desktop"** and follow the prompts in the GitHub Desktop Application or follow the instructions from **[this link](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop)** to see how to clone the repository in other ways. 

#### Heroku Deployment  
1. Set up local workspace for Heroku 
    - In terminal window of your IDE type: ```pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt.``` (Heroku detects this as a Python app. The reason that they've been able to detect Python is because we have a requirements.txt file)

    - In terminal window of your IDE type: ```echo "python app.py" > Procfile``` (The file is needed for Heroku to know which file is needed as entry point.)
1. Set up Heroku: create a Heroku account, create a new app and select your region. 
2. Deployment method 'Github'
    - Click on the **Connect to GitHub** section in the deploy tab in Heroku. 
        - Search your repository to connect with it.
        - When your repository appears click on **connect** to connect your repository with the Heroku. 
    - Go to the settings app in Heroku and go to **Config Vars**. Click on **Reveal Config Vars**.
        - Enter the variables contained in your env.py file. it is about: **IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME**
3. Push the requirements.txt and Procfile to the repository. 
     ```
    $ git add requirements.txt
    $ git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"

    $ git add Procfile 
    $ git commit -m "Add Procfile"
    ```
4. Automatic deployment: Go to the deploy tab in Heroku and scroll down to **Automatic deployments**. Click on **Enable Automatic Deploys**. By **Manual deploy** click on **Deploy Branch**.

Heroku will receive the code from Github and host the app using the required packages. 
Click on **Open app** in the right corner of your Heroku account. The app wil open and the live link is available from the address bar. 


### Forking the GitHub Repository
The repository can be forked on GitHub, this creates a copy of the repository that can be viewed or amended without affecting the original repository. This can be done using the following steps:

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- At the top right of the repository (under your avatar) locate the Fork button and click this button.
- There should now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can amend.

### Cloning the GitHub Repository
A clone of the repository can be made, which will create a local copy on your own computer. Changes can be made to this local copy and it will not affect the original repository. Follow these steps to clone the Sunrise Yoga repository.

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- Click the button called "Code".
- Under HTTPS copy the link provided, in this case ().
- Go to Gitpod or whichever IDE you are using and open the Terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type 'git clone' followed by the url you copied in step 3.
- Press "Enter" to create the local clone.
- You can refer to the GitHub documentation for more detailed information on the above process [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
